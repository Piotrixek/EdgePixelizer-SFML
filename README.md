# EdgePixelizer-SFML
A desktop application built with C++, SFML, OpenCV, and ImGui that converts images into pixelated edge art. Allows real-time adjustment of parameters like scaling, pixel size, brightness/contrast, blur, and Canny edge detection thresholds. Generates coordinate lists for the resulting pixel blocks in various formats (C#, JS, Python).
